 * The RtfDirectContent makes it possible to directly add RTF code into an RTF document. This can be
 * used to directly add RTF fragments that have been created with other RTF editors. One important
 * aspect is that font and color numbers will not be modified. This means that the fonts and colors
 * visible in the final document might not be equivalent with those set on the direct content.<br>
 * <br>
 * For convenience the RtfDirectContent provides a DIRECT_SOFT_LINEBREAK constant that makes it
 * possible to easily add soft line-breaks anywhere in the RTF document.
